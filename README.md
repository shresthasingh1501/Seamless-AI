## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **LID**: Contains the implementation of Language Identification (LID) for both text and speech inputs, leveraging the SpeechBrain toolkit.
- **Models Used**: Provides information about the pre-trained models utilized in the project.
- **Notebook-Recipes**: Includes Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the usage of Bhashini pipelines and Seamless AI pipelines.
- **SeamlessGlasses**: This directory houses the core implementation of our product offering Seamless Glasses, Concept AR Smart Glasses with Seamless AI's pipelines.
- **Stella**: Contains the source code for the  demo chatbot "Stella," a multilingual chatbot showcasing Seamless AI's capabilities.

## Technologies Used

Seamless AI is built upon a robust ensemble of state-of-the-art open-source models, carefully curated and integrated to deliver exceptional performance:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Models**:
  - Mixtral 8x7B: For text comprehension and generation.
  - Bhashini Suite: Provides automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and machine translation (NMT) capabilities for Indian languages.
  - Whisper Large V2 : Backup ASR 

- **Multimodal AI Models**:
  - FireLLaVA 13B: Combines language understanding and computer vision for multimodal processing.
  - CogVLM: Enables image analysis and textual description generation.

- **Image Generation**:
  - Stable Diffusion XL: Generates high-fidelity images based on textual prompts.

## Key Features

- **Multimodal Interactions**: Support for text, speech, image, and video inputs, enabling natural and intuitive user interactions.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports 11 Indian languages, including low-resource ones, breaking down language barriers.
- **Fast Processing Speeds**: Optimized pipelines for real-time, responsive interactions.
- **Cloud-Based Integration**: Cloud-based architecture allows low-resource devices to leverage Seamless AI's advanced capabilities.
